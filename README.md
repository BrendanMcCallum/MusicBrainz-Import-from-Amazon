## <a name="amazon"></a> MusicBrainz: Import from Amazon

Import album data from Amazon to add a new release on MusicBrainz.

[![Install](https://raw.github.com/jerone/UserScripts/master/_resources/Install-button.jpg)](https://github.com/dufferZafar/Userscripts/raw/master/MB-Import-From-Amazon.user.js)

### Description

The script adds a button on Amazon pages (that contain a music album) which allows you to create a new release from the data present on the page.

The main aim of creating the script is to facilitate the process of adding Hindi albums from Amazon. So the script has mostly been tested on Hindi album pages of Amazon.

*Note: As Amazon makes changes to its website (which happens frequently) this script might stop functioning.*

### Todo

* Make it work with Digital Music releases like: www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K0CR61Y/ & www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J9NKCJI/

* Make it work when *Singers* data is incomplete - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JOBUWCC/
